<p>As a good business person, you want your customers to order bikes of their choice. An elementary form with a few fields would do — the name, surname, and phone number would be enough. One crucial requirement is that customers should be able to order only those bikes with all the parts available. Disappointing customers is not your way of business.</p>
<p>To complete this stage, create a simple form with three fields — name, surname, and phone number and add it to the template used to generate bike pages. Each form field should be in a separate paragraph.</p>
<p>Next, check whether all the bike parts are available in the shop: the frame and seat of the specified color, tires (remember, two tires per bike!), and a basket if needed. If you have all the parts — display the form. If any parts are unavailable, show <code class="java">Unfortunately, this bike is currently not available</code> in bold and in the <code class="java">&lt;p&gt;</code> tag instead of the form. For more information, check the screenshots below.</p>
<p>No need to worry about handling post requests at this point; we will take care of them in the next stage.</p>
