<p>We have the database up and running; it's time to fill it with data on your shop's bikes! The staff needs the admin panel where they can add all the relevant information on available bikes and parts. </p>
<p>It would be best if you also started working on the actual website. Perhaps, having the main page with all the available bikes would make a good start?</p>
<p>Let's start with the admin panel! First, you need to register all the models in the <em>admin.py</em> file. Once you've done it, it's time to create a superuser — use the username, email address, and password of your choice. Next, log in to the admin panel (it should be available at <em>localhost:8000/admin/) </em>and add some data. Remember to start with frames, seats, tires, and available baskets. After this, build some bikes out of the available components. Adding 2-3 cycles of different frame colors, seats, and tire types is a good idea. Add some variations with baskets; it will make the testing easier in the later stages. Please don't add any orders for now; they are for later stages.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">If you want to make your admin panel more user-friendly and display the name of your bike instead of <code class="java">Bike object (1)</code>,<em> </em>use the<em> </em><code class="java">__str__()</code> method. You can read more on the method in the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/models/instances/#str" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">official documentation</a>.</div><p></p>
<p>It would also be great to see the bikes listed nicely on the website, wouldn't it? Let's draw up such a page. Create a dedicated view, the <em>urls.py</em> file, with relevant content and add a template. The page should be available at <em>localhost:8000/bikes/. </em>There is only one requirement on how the page should look — all the bikes from the database should be displayed as separate elements of the unordered list; all the rest is up to you. Check the screenshot below as a reference.</p>
